A collection of tools for increasing developer productivity.

## scripts/ dir

Contains shell scripts that the Python CLI calls into.

### Rationale

One purpose of this project is to practice bash scripting. I know how to do things in Python, but not as much in bash. So Python is there just for auto-complete, to tie everything together in a single useful package.
