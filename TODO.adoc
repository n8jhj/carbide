* [ ] Create "self" or "config" group with "enable-completion" command to auto-generate the necessary autocomplete stuff according to directions at https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/shell-completion/#enabling-completion.
* [ ] Create command to get you in the state for PR review w/ a specified repo and branch.
* [ ] Command to go to a registered dir.
* [ ] Command to register a specified .py argparse script for running thru this CLI.
* [ ] Command to make a TOML-based acronym file. Possibly convert it to Asciidoc too.
* [ ] Command to help create estimation tables. Would be nice to be able to sum hour estimates by row and column. Could be AsciiDoc!
* [ ] Command to take me to the specified section of a specified/registered repo.
* [ ] Command using `nmap` to map desktop network topology.
* [ ] Would be nice to integrate some sort of TODO tracking on a large scale (like a TODO list you might keep on your whiteboard).
